#This is a simple script for building levels.
# As you can see it supports line comments, just put a '#' at the start of any line to comment it out.
# technically any line that doesn't start with a TileObject should just get passed over, but it's good practice to comment.
Uncomented lines that can't be parsed are still checked, so it's technically slower to leave them blank. Plus you can more easily introduce
#bugs.

# SpawnPoints take 2 parameters an x position and a y position. it's a 1x1 tile placed at that location used for spawning the player.
SpawnPoint x=4 y=20

# your default Platform. rungs accross the bottom of the screen 1 unit high. Not really useful if you want something more complex
Platform
# These platforms are more flexible, you pass the (x,y) coordinates of the top left most tile then the number of tiles it expands
# towards the right and bottom.
Platform x=18 y=28 width=3 height=1
Platform x=25 y=26 width=2 height=1
Platform x=20 y=23 width=4 height=1

# Default DeathZone makes an invisible death pit below the screen. extends out past the screen in both directions and is several tiles
# deep, in an attempt to ensure catching the player when he falls
DeathZone
# When you add parameters to a DeathZone the first four are identical to the Platform, the last paramter tells you if you draw the object.
# So yes you can have invisible DeathZones throughout your level. 
DeathZone 22 27 6 2 true

# VictoryZone requires 2 parameters, (x,y) coordinates which will place a 2x2 square. parameters are for the top left tile.
